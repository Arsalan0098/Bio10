										<p class="bigger-text"> <strong class="theme_color">General Description</strong></p>
										<p>The Bio10-Blanca project addresses the growing need for sustainable
											plant disease management solutions. Traditional chemical treatments
											can harm soil health and ecosystems, highlighting the need for organic
											alternatives. Bio10-Blanca is an advanced organic formulation that
											combines sea-minerals and botanical extracts to create a high pH
											environment on plant surfaces. This elevated pH acts as a natural barrier,
											effectively deterring bacterial and fungal pathogens from settling. By
											providing a non-toxic and eco-friendly solution, Bio10-Blanca aims to
											enhance plant health and support sustainable agricultural practices.</p>

									<p class="bigger-text"> <strong class="theme_color">Research History:</strong></p>

									<h4 class="text-uppercase">Phase 1: Concept Development</h4>
									<ul class="styled-list-two">
										<li><b>Year:</b> 2020</li>
										<li><b>Description:</b> The project began with the exploration of
											concentrated sea-mineral extracts and plant response,
											identifying beneficial effects. Initial studies focused on how
											these properties enhance plant health and resistance to
											diseases.</li>
									</ul>

									<h4 class="text-uppercase">Phase 2: Formulation Testing</h4>
									<ul class="styled-list-two">
										<li><b>Year:</b> 2021</li>
										<li><b>Description:</b> Extensive testing was conducted to
											optimise the mineral and extract blend. Various formulations
											were evaluated for their effectiveness in creating a high pH
											environment and their impact on different plant types.</li>
									</ul>

									<h4 class="text-uppercase">Phase 3: Prototype Development</h4>
									<ul class="styled-list-two">
										<li><b>Year:</b> 2021 - 2022</li>
										<li><b>Description:</b> A prototype of Bio10-Blanca was
											developed and tested in controlled environments. The
											prototype was assessed for its ability to prevent disease
											settlement and its compatibility with different plant species.</li>
									</ul>

									<h4 class="text-uppercase">Phase 4: Field Trials</h4>
									<ul class="styled-list-two">
										<li><b>Year:</b> 2022 - Current</li>
										<li><b>Description:</b> Field trials were carried out to evaluate the
											product’s performance in real agricultural settings. Results
											were analysed to refine the formulation and application
											methods.</li>
									</ul>

									<h4 class="text-uppercase">Phase 5: Commercialisation</h4>
									<ul class="styled-list-two">
										<li><b>Year:</b> 2023 - Current</li>
										<li><b>Description:</b> Following successful trials, Bio10-Blanca
											is being prepared for commercial launch. Ongoing refinement
											ensures that the product meets market needs and maintains
											high efficacy.</li>
									</ul>

									<p class="bigger-text"> <strong class="theme_color">Current Update</strong></p>
									<p> As of mid-2024, Bio10-blanca has made considerable progress
										in its development and application:</p>
										<ul class="styled-list-two">
											<li><b>Formulation Development:</b> The Bio10-Blanca
												formulation, which combines concentrated sea-minerals with
												botanical extracts, has been successfully finalised. This
												advanced blend creates a high-mineral, high-pH environment
												on plant surfaces, effectively disrupting the growth and
												germination of fungal spores and inhibiting the settlement of
												bacterial pathogens. The solution modifies the pH and nutrient
												conditions to make the plant surface less conducive to
												pathogen development. Rigorous testing has been conducted
												to ensure the formulation’s effectiveness in providing robust
												disease protection.</li>
											<li><b>Initial Trials:</b> Preliminary trials have been conducted to
												assess the performance of Bio10-Blanca in real-world
												conditions. These trials have demonstrated that the product
												effectively raises the pH of plant surfaces, creating an
												inhospitable environment for disease-causing microorganisms.
												Feedback from these trials has been positive, highlighting the
												formulation's potential to enhance plant health and resilience.</li>
											<li><b>Product Refinement:</b> Based on initial trial results, the
												formulation is being refined to improve its stability and
												performance. Adjustments are being made to optimise the
												product's effectiveness and ensure consistent results across
												different plant species and growing conditions.</li>
										</ul>


										<p class="bigger-text"> <strong class="theme_color">What's Next</strong></p>
										<p>Looking ahead, we are focusing on several key areas to further
										enhance Bio10-Blanca and to expand its impact:</p>
										<ul class="styled-list-two">
											<li><b>Extended Field Trials:</b >We plan to conduct additional
												field trials across a broader range of agricultural settings
												to validate the product's performance under different
												conditions and with various crop types. These trials will
												help to further refine the product and confirm its
												benefits.</li>

											<li><b>Product Line Development:</b> We are developing
												complementary products to address specific needs and
												application methods. This could include formulations
												for specialised crops or different growth stages.</li>

											<li><b>Ongoing R&D:</b> Continuous research will focus on
												enhancing the formulation and exploring new scientific
												advancements to improve the product further. We are
												committed to incorporating user feedback and staying
												at the forefront of sustainable agriculture technology.</li>
										</ul>
